# Object Oriented Analysis Uses Cases

## Object Oriented Analysis

- Object oriented analysis focuses on the problem and the requirements. 
- Focus on what the system is supposed to do. 
- Implementation details are mostly ignored.
- An analysis model is created
    - Done through user stories or uses cases
    - Involves key abstractions from the problem domain.
    - Constraints of technologies are ignored.

- Steps
    1. Find the key objects.
    2. Describe how they interact.
    3. Define the internal behavior of each object.

### Example : Car Game (Reckless Driver)
