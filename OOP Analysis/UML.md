## What is UML?

- UML is the "Unified Modelling Language"
- It is the standard modelling language for software development.
- Maintained by Object Management Group
- Current version is 2.5
- Brings together ideas of three modelling methods of Jacobson, Rumbaugh & Booch.
- Made up of pseudo-code, actual code, pictures, diagrams, etc.
- Describes the system we want to develop.
- Depends mostly on notations to describe the system.

## What UML Is Not
- It is not a modelling tool.
    - It is just a way to model a system.
- It is not a programming language.
- It is not a methodology or a process.
    - Rather it helps document various stages of a process.

## Why UML?

- Systems design on a large scale is difficult.
- All kinds of applications will have thousands of components that interact with each other. 
    - components need to be tracked
    - usefulness of a component for a system has to be ascertained. 
    - customer requirements have to be considered. 
- Designs need to be shared with stakeholders
- UML helps model this kind of complexity.
    - captures, documents and helps communicate important aspects of the system's design.

## UML Advantages

- Formal Language
- Concise
- Comprehensive
- Scalable
- Standard

## UML Development process

- Waterfall
    - Analysis, Design, Coding & Testing
- Iterative(Most Common)
    - Solve project in pieces.
    - Define system functionality in beginning. 
    - Begin analysis design coding and testing on each individual piece. 

## UML Planning Process

- Predictive Planning - Rarely used
- Adaptive Planning (Agile Development)
- If you can easily list all requirements use Predictive planning.
- Create use cases
