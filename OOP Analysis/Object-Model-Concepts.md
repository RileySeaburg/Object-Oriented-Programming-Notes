# Object Model Concepts

## Evolution of Languages

- Early computer languages we uses for mathematical and scientific operations.
    - Freed the programmer from the intricacies of assembly languages.
- Growth in size and complexity led to evolution in languages to accommodate new features. 
    - e.g. automation for business applications.
- Slowly the languages evolved even more.
    - Software moved close to problem domain and further away from the machine. 

## Object Model

- The newer languages used classes & objects instead of subprograms and algorithms as building blocks.
- These languages build upon the object model.
- The object model is based on three important concepts.
    - Object oriented analysis
    - Object oriented design
    - Object oriented programming

### Object Oriented Analysis

*"OO analysis is a method of analysis that examines the requirements from the perspective of the classes and objects found in the vocabulary of the problem domain"*
                                        - Grady Booch
                                        ["Object Oriented Analysis & Design with Applications 3'rd Edition"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/object-oriented-analysis-and/9780201895513/)
- This is the first step for develop an object oriented system.
- Investigation of the problem and requirements rather than the solution.
- Focuses on what the system is supposed to do rather than how it will be done. 
- Looks at the behavior of the system independent of it's domain.
- Examines the real-wold environment in which the system will operate. 
    - Includes people and things that will interact to produce some results
    - Analysed in basic abstract forms, in multiple iterations.
    - These abstractions later become classes in the problem domain.
