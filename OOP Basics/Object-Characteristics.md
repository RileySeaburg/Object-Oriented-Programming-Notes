## Object Definition
*An object represents an individual, identifiable item, unit or entity, either real or abstract, with a well defined role in the problem domain.*
                                        - Smith and Tockey

- Model some part of reality.
- Exists in space and time.
- Can be invented as outcome of a design process.
- Has well-defined behavior and a definite purpose.
- Collaborate with other objects to provide a higher-level behavior.

## Characteristics

- An object has the following characteristics:
    - State
    - Identity
    - Behavior
- The structure and behavior of similar objects are spe a class.
    - Object is an instance of such a class.
    - A class is a blueprint for objects.
- Forms the building block of an application.

## State

- Properties and their values constiture the state of an object.
- Appear as attributes of an object.
    - Fields, member variables, etc.
- Can be of two types
    - Static - fundamental attributes that don't change.
    - Dynamic - attributes that change as a result of operation performed on the object.

## Identity

- Represented through one or more attributes of the object. 
    - Address of an object can be used to represent it's iden in some cases
- Helps identify objects in a system

    - Cellphone - IMEI no.
    - Person - SSN.

## Behavior

- Response of the object during interaction.
- Part of the responsibility of an object.
- Arises due to binding between attributes and operations.
    - Operations will internally change the state of the object.
    - This culminates into the behavior of the object.
- Appear as operations (member functions, methods.)
- Examples 
    - Speaker System - ChangeVolume, ChangeBass, ChangeTreble, EqualizeLoudness
    - Cellphone - SendText, Dial, AcceptCall, Connect

## Examples

- Bank account
- Credit Card
- File on a hard drive
- Employee

## Summary

- Object is an entity, real or abstract, identifiable, in some problem domain.
- Has the following characteristics
    - State
    - Identity
    - Behavior
- Their blueprint is represented by a class.
- Objects do not exist in isolation.
- Interdependent, coordinate.
